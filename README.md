# Android - Project Note:

I think I forgot to put in instruction on how the app works.
So first in order to start the game the user has to make a registration,after that is done the information aboult the user is saved in the
DataBase and then he will get a message "Registered successfully".After that is done you have to press the Sign in button and you have to 
log in.When you do then the game will open.
